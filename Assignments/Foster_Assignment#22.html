<p>
<span class= "Orange"> San Francico Giants </span>  win tonight's game over the <span class= "maroon"> Arizona Diamond Backs </span> 5-3 on the back of a strong pitching performance from  Madison Bumbgardner. Bumbgardner lasted 7 IP striking out 7 and giving up 4 hits while allowing 2 ER with no walks. Tonight's performance lowers Bumbgardner's ERA to 2.52 for the year and further cements his candidacy for the CY Young award. Buster Posey had himself a fine game as well going 2 for 4 with a single and a 3 run homerun in the 5th. The win moves the <span class= "Orange"> Giants </span> record to 64-52 on the season and puts them 3 games back of their rival the <span class= "blue">Los Angeles Dodgers </span>. <span class="Orange"> San Francico's </span> next game is tomorrow night against the Milwaukee Brewers first pitch at 7:07 pst.
